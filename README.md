# GridDraw
Hex or square grid generator with several grid options

This is a project I've thrown together to create a hex grid or square grid that can be exported to a PNG file

Grid Options:
  - select between hex or square grid style
  - adjust orientation of grid cells to be flat or pointed at top/bottom
  - adjust the radius (center to corner) of cells that make up the grid
  - adjust the number of grid rows and grid columns
  - adjust relative scales of each grid cell with respect to the grid
  - choose alignment of the the grid cells
  - adjust grid line/cell outline thickness
  - adjust grid line color w/transparency
  - select grid cell center point
  - adjust grid cell fill color w/transparency
  - add various style grid cell labeling, with custom prefixes or suffixes, fonts, font colors, rotation, etc.
  - draw grid using anti-aliasing or not
  - adjust canvas color w/transparency
